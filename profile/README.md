Hab Track is a project made by [Lande](https://github.com/laande) to keep track update on Habbo and Habbo retro

Pretty much everything is on the [discord](https://discord.gg/7SvKF6wpss)

But i also made a tiny [website](https://hab-track.vercel.app/) to have a graphical representation of the changes

Don't hesitate to join the discord, give me suggestion or even contribute to the projet ! :)
